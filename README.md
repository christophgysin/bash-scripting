# bash scripting

This is a presentation about bash, written in [remark](http://remarkjs.org).

It can be viewed and presented [directly in a browser](
http://christophgysin.github.io/bash-scripting/bash-scripting.html).

- [bash-scripting.html](
  http://christophgysin.github.io/bash-scripting/bash-scripting.html)
  contains incremental slides.
- [bash-scripting-slides.html](
  http://christophgysin.github.io/bash-scripting/bash-scripting-slides.html
  ) contains only complete slides.

## How do I create a PDF out of remark slides?

- open the Developer Tools (Ctrl-Shift-J)
- set the resolution to 1024x768
- open the print dialog (Ctrl-P)
- choose destination "Save as PDF"
